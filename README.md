## Overview

### The challenges

- Dynamic Content Integration:
    Ensuring that Frame motion worked correctly with dynamically loaded content in React was tricky. Reinitializing the Frame motion library after content updates required careful management to avoid glitches or performance issues.
- Dynamic Performance 
    Optimizing changing on products for smooth performance was essential, especially on devices with limited processing power. Fine-tuning the animation trigger points and viewport offsets was necessary for a responsive feel.
- Customizing colors
    Adapting the colors to match the website's design vision was a challenge. This involved difining divs for background of product's images, time control, and easing curves to create a cohesive experience.
